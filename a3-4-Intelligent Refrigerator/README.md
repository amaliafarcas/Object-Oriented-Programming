# Assignment 02-03

## Requirements
- Each student will be given one of the problems below.
- The solution must use the **C language**.
- Solve all problem requirements.
- Define a vector structure with specific operations using a dynamically allocated array.
- Use modular programming.
- Source code must be specified and include tests for all non-UI functions
- The program must not leak memory!
- Use a layered architecture for your application (domain, repository, controller, UI). User interface, domain and data access elements will be stored in different modules. The user interface module will only contain the user interface part.
- Have at least 10 entries available at application startup.
- Handle user input errors gracefully (replace program crashes with nice error messages :blush:).

## Problem Statement

### Intelligent Refrigerator
The company *“Home SmartApps”* have decided to design a new intelligent refrigerator. Besides the hardware, they need a software application to manage the refrigerator. Each **Product** that the fridge can store has a `name`, a `category` (one of `dairy, sweets, meat or fruit`), a `quantity` and an `expiration date`. The software application will provide the following functionalities:\
**(a)** Add, delete or update a product. A product is uniquely identified by name and category. If a product that already exists is added, its quantity will be updated (the new quantity is added to the existing one).\
**(b)** Display all products whose name contains a given string (if the string is empty, all products from the refrigerator are considered), and show them sorted ascending by the existing quantity.\
**(c)** Display all products of a given category (if the category is empty, all types of food will be considered) whose expiration dates are close (expire in the following `X` days, where the value of `X` is user-provided).\
**(d)** Provide multiple undo and redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the previous operation performed by the user.
